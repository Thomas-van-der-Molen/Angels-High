# Angels High
### Weapons Free
A sim-cade style combat flight simulator built in C++ with Unreal Engine 4, featuring realistic and intuitive aircraft controls and physics, stunning graphics, and engaging first and third person views.

You can play the game by downloading [AngelsHigh-Game](https://github.com/flyscript/Angels-High/blob/master/AngelsHigh-Game) and launching the .exe

Whilst not natively launchable in VR, this game can be played in Virtual Reality from within the UE4 editor for maximum immersion!

This game was built in Unreal Engine 4 with C++, and you can open it in-engine by downloading [AngelsHigh-Source](https://github.com/flyscript/Angels-High/blob/master/AngelsHigh-Source/) and opening the .uproject. This will prompt you to select a build of Unreal with which to open it. The game will then open after Unreal has built its requisit project files.

Some blueprints were used for constructing child classe's transforms and physical layouts.
