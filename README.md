# Weapons Free
 A sim-cade style combat flight simulator with realistic and intuitive aircraft controls and physics, stunning graphics, and engaging first and third person views.

You can play the game by [downloading AngelsHigh-Game](https://github.com/flyscript/Angels-High/blob/master/AngelsHigh-Game) and launching the .exe

This game was built in Unreal Engine 4, and you can open it in-engine by [downloading AngelsHigh-Source](https://github.com/flyscript/Angels-High/blob/master/AngelsHigh-Source/AngelsHighWF.uproject) and opening the .uproject. This will prompt you to select a build of Unreal with which to open it. The game will then open after Unreal has built its requisitproject files.
